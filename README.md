Image-OP
========
Image OP performs image operations via a scripting language.
Can do:
*Pixel operations on both user input/other values
*Neighbour hood operations from user input such as blurring.
*If blocks comparing the current pixel/position of the current pixel
*Seperate passes, so you can perform a pixel operation on the first pass, and a blur on the second for example
